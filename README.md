# RACE GAME
 It is a mini project game based on HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT.In this, i used 2 cars; blue car and red car and with a background of a road.Here with the right and left arrow keys we can move our red car right and left so tht it dont collide with blue car.
 Once it gets collide with blue car, the game will get over with your score display over the screen.
